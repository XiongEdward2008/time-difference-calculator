# Time Difference Calculator

People may travel or study abroad, but they still want to keep in touch. This project helps people find their shared free time, which helps them decide how to arrange their schedules.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Select your timezone and the other's timezone, input your free time start and end, and the other's free time start and end. Click "Calculate Overlap" to see the overlapping hours and the overlapping time periods in both timezones.

## Example

Your timezone: UTC+8, free time 08:00 - 11:00  
Other's timezone: UTC+9, free time 08:00 - 09:00  

Result: Overlapping hours: 1.00  
In your timezone (UTC+8): 09:00 - 10:00  
In other's timezone (UTC+9): 08:00 - 09:00
